## Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz:** PCR and GMO



**Here are the key items and study points you should review for the quiz:**


- You should be able to define and explain:

    - Why PCR is a useful technique in molecular biology
    - What the stages of the PCR process are and what happens at each stage (e.g. denature, anneal, extend)
    - What the chemical components of PCR are (e.g. polymerase, primer, template DNA, etc.) and what their purpose is.


You should be able to answer questions on the following topics


- A definition for GMO/GMO Organisims

- An example of how Genetic Engineering is used to improve food or argriculture

- Know what gene is an indicator (marker) of potential modification

  - Grinding sample in the Edwards buffer and incubating samples in a heated water bath
  - Centrifuging the heated sample and transfering supernantant to a new tube
  - Adding isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to supernantant

- Be able to define what an experimental control is and the three basic types of control

- Be able to interpreit a simulated (diagram) of a GMO experiment electrophoresis and determine

  - If a sample DNA extraction likely worked
  - If a sample was likely GMO
  - If primer dimer is present
