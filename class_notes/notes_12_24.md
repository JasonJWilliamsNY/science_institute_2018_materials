## Semester-end assignment - short essay

#### Essay instructions

For the semester-end assignment, you will complete a short essay (750 words max).
The essay should be in two-parts (each of which can be one more more paragraphs,
but again the entire work should be less than 750 words). Use a word count
to ensure you do not go above 750 words (this is available in Google docs and
Microsoft Word). This should probably take about 1-1.5 hours including research
time. This is due at the end of the finals period - 5PM, Wednesday January 16th.

**Part I The Ethics of CRISPR**

This part of your essay should be a short introduction (suitable for entry
in a school newspaper, or an in-class presentation) about CIRSPR and the
controversial work of the scientist He Jiankui.

You should give simple explanations that cover the following points. The
explanations should be simple enough to make sense for your 10th grade peers
who have not taken more than 9th grade biology.

1. What is CRISPR?
2. What did He Jiankui do?
3. Why are there ethical concerns about Dr. He's work?

You should draw on

1. Your previous homework and research in our class on the Ethics of DNA
2. [This Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07607-3) on Dr. He's work.  
3. [This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/jAhjPd4uNFY) on CRISPR
4. Any other reference you wish to include

For any reference or quotations, be sure to include a citation at the end of
your work (e.g. The title of the article, its author, and a link to the work if
it is from an online source.)

*How will this section be graded?*
This section will probably need to be bigger (~ 500 words) than the next section
but how you allocate your words is up to you. This section will be graded
for how well it covers the three points, and that it provides a explanation that
would make sense to the "average" 10th grader (e.g. complex terms are defined
and assumption that they know some biology, but maybe not as much as you.). You
should also prompt the reader to ask ethical questions, but you do not have to
give your own opinion. It's probably important to inform your reader about other
historical examples of ethical issues in biology and medicine.

**Part II CRISPR detective**

In the final section you will be asked to use your knowledge of the biology we
have covered this year to answer a question.

"How would you be able to detect if a person had a CRISPR modification in their
genome?"

Using what you know about:

- DNA extraction
- PCR
- Electorphoresis
- DNA sequencing
- BLAST

Come up with a short (but accurate!) explanation of how we might detect a change
in someone's genome that was caused by CRISPR.

*How will this section be graded?*

While it is not necessary to put so much detail that we could use this paragraph
as a laboratory protocol, you should explain how each of the technology/methods
listed would be used to determine if an individual had a change in their DNA,
perhaps one that was caused by CIRSPR. While you may not have all the information
to anticipate some problems with your approach, do the best you can with the
knowledge you have, and try to make sure that statements you make about these
technologies are accurate.
