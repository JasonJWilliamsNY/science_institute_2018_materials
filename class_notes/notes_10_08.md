## Molecular Biology

**“The same few dozen organic molecules are used over and over again in biology for the widest variety of functions.” ― Carl Sagan**

In this class, we will give the briefest possible review to the subject that will occupy most of our next few months - [molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology). Molecular biology for us largely deals with understanding the life through the lens of its chemical components, mainly DNA. There is much more to life than DNA, but life as we know it largely depends on this (and other) nucleic acids. We will cover the basics and get our first introduction to the technologies and approaches that unlock this special molecule.

### Lab Protocol

We will be following this protocol for our lab:
- [Mitochondrial DNA laboratory exercise](http:www.geneticorigins.org/mito/laboratory.html)

### Resources

Much of our introductory information will draw on the [DNA from the Beginning](http://www.dnaftb.org/) website. There is much more to explore there, but here is what we need for today:

- [DNA and proteins are key molecules of the cell nucleus](http://www.dnaftb.org/15/)
- [Mutations are changes in genetic information](http://www.dnaftb.org/27/)
