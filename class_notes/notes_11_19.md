3. Chain Reaction
   
### Lecture

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is one of the most important techniques in the molecular biology toolkit. PCR allows us to replicate a <u>specific</u> piece of DNA in the genome. Replicating a piece of DNA is the first step to analyzing it (via [DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing)). Replicated DNA is also often one of the first steps to editing DNA for subsequent experiments.
