## GMO Foods Lab Analysis

#### Week of February 25th, 2019

----

**Assignment**

1. Make sure you have your copy of the [GMO Food Lab](../papers_articles/gmo_foods_lab.pdf), use it to review the
   following sections
   - Review the introduction to the lab on pg. 5
   - We will review in class the protocol on pg. 8-11 ... especially PCR,
     you should review our previous notes on [PCR](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2018_materials/blob/master/class_notes/notes_11_19.md) as our next text will
     cover this material after our in-class review.
 2. Photos of your results are available
    - [Group 1 raw](../images_results/feb_gmo/group1_raw.jpg)  | [Group 1 edited](../images_results/feb_gmo/group1_edited.jpg)
    - [Group 2 raw](../images_results/feb_gmo/group2_raw.jpg)  | [Group 2 edited](../images_results/feb_gmo/group2_edited.jpg)
    - [Group 3 raw](../images_results/feb_gmo/group3_raw.jpg)  | [Group 3 edited](../images_results/feb_gmo/group3_edited.jpg)
    - We also have a photo of the [ladder](../images_results/feb_gmo/neb1kb.gif)
  3. Using your photos (the edited photos are higher contrast), do your best to
     do the following; we will go over your work on our next class.
     1. Label the lanes on your gel (you can either print the photo, or download
       it and use any photo editing software)
     2. Try to determine if you have  a ban in your gel. You must be careful to
        not count very faint bands that are not PCR amplification, but "primer dimer"
        (See an explanation of primer dimer on pg. 18 of the lab protocol, including
        the gel and paragraph d.).
     3. Try to determine if you can draw conclusions for the evidence you have,
        Do you have bands in control samples (tubulin or your +CNTRL GMO plant
        leaf)? If you have very few bands, you can look at gels from the other

In next week's class we will decided what and how we would like to repeat and see
if we can further improve our results in another round of extractions and PCR.
