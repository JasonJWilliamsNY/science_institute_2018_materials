## The Ethics of DNA

#### Week of November 26th, 2016

In this virtual class, we will explore the idea of ethics as it relates to our work in the lab. 

### Homework
Answer pre- lecture questions/Vocabulary 

**Time:** Including viewing the lectures, listening activities, questions, and reading, this should require 60-120 minutes of time. Think about doing most of this during the time of our normal class. 


**Pre-Lecture Questions:**
Before looking at the materials, give one- or two-sentence answers to the following questions. Just give your best answer - 'right' or 'wrong' does not matter here. 

1. What is "ethics"?
2. As you have learned different subjects in school (math, writing, science, etc.) have you ever been asked if the skills you learned (addition, persuasive essay writing, how to extract DNA) is ethical, or related to ethics?

**Pre-Lecture Vocabulary:**

Find definitions for the following terms. Please attempt to state the definitions in your own words:

1. Ethics
2. Informed consent
3. Institutional Review Board
4. Genetic counseling
5. GINA (Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act)
6. Eugenics

**Lecture:**

This week, Chinese scientists annouced they have been editing embryos using a powerful new technology called CRISPR [article](https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/26/chinese-crispr-edited-babies/). We will talk more about CIRSPR in class. 
This lecture is a powerful one, and although I have a lot to say, I am not recording a video for this lecture. Instead, I'd like you to spend a few minutes listening to the following stories and forming your own opinions. We will discuss in class.

- the ethics of dna use: [3 podcasts, ~15 minutes total listening](http://www.npr.org/series/17128722/the-ethics-of-dna-use)
