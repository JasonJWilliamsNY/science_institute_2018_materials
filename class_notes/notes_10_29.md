# Virtual lab - Bioinformatics analysis of Mitochondrial DNA

## Summary

In this virtual class, we will take a first look at analyzing mitochondrial DNA
results using [DNA Subway](https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/). The analysis of
biological data (such as your DNA sequence) is an area of biology called [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) and is an important component of doing research.

**Due Date:** Submit answers to your questions by 5:00PM 11/5 (i.e. have this
done before our next class). Although this assignment is not graded, do the
best you can to answer all questions. The video link is approximately 15 minutes.
Answering questions and reviewing the resources should 30-45 minutes.

#### Analyzing MT DNA with DNA Subway

##### Viewing Sequence

1. Under "Assemble sequences" click on  Sequence Viewer to see the available 
   DNA sequences that have been loaded. 
2. Exit the 'Sequence Viewer' window

##### Find Sequence Matches

1. Click on the 'BLAST' tool.
2. Next to the name of your sequence click 'BLAST'; use the result to answer lab question 3.
3. Exit the 'BLAST' window

##### Compare sequences

1. Click on 'Select Data'
2. Click on all of the "ModernHuman" and "Student" DNA selections, then  click'Save Selections'
3. Click on 'MUSCLE' to run the tool, click again to view the results.
2. In the 'Alignment Viewer' window click 'Trim Alignment'
3. Click on the 'ATGC' box to view details of the sequence comparison.

# 11/6 Quiz Review Items

This quiz will focus on the following topics 

1. General knowledge of mitochondrial DNA (size, location, inheritance patterns)
2. The DNA extraction and electrophoresis portion of the [mitochondrial DNA lab](http://www.geneticorigins.org/mito/laboratory.html). You should know 
 * What the purpose of the saline solution is (and why we use 0.9% concentration)
 * What the role of chelex is in the experiment
 * What the purpose of boiling the cells is
 * What electrophoresis reveals about DNA copied by PCR
 * Why we use a ladder on an electrophoresis gel
 * Why we use loading dye to add samples to the electrophoresis gel
 
3. Introductory topics on gene
 * A basic explanation in your own words on what a gene is
 * How to explain the relationship between DNA, genes, and chromosomes
 * What gene conservation is
 * What the major types of mutations are
