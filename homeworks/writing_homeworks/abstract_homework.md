## Homework Assignment

### Abstracts

**Due**: March 25, 2019

This is the first in a series of homework assignments to familiarize you with scientific writing. A scientist has a **responsibility** to communicate their work, to other scientists, students, and the public. In fact, the large majority of scientists are funded by public agencies (e.g. in the US, the [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov/), the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/)). These agencies have the mission of advancing scientific discovery for the benefit of the public.

The responsibility to communicate science involves the necessity of communicating accurately and truthfully all of the facts relating to a scientific project. While the majority of science communication involves new discoveries, we are also interested in experiments that further confirm an existing theory, or results that may challenge a theory or assumption.

Most often, the way scientists report their findings is by means of an article, which in our high school context is very much like a lab report. A research article will usually include the following sections (usually, but not necessarily in this order):

- **Abstract**: A summary of the research findings and their significance
- **Introduction**: Background on the topic, such as why it is important, what previous questions have been asked and what is still unknown
- **Results**: Experimental data including measurements, photos, graphs, and figures
- **Discussion**: An explanation of the findings and the conclusions the author(s) want you understand
- **Methods**: An explanation of the experiments and procedures used in research - sufficiently detailed for you to understand what was done and how you could repeat the experiment.
- **References**: A list of the previous research that was consulted in developing the experiments, or that is relevant to the research.

Here is a professional paper that gives scientists advice on how to write a scientific paper:
-  [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)

It is a long paper (and you don't have to read it all, but perhaps look at the figures and read through any paragraph heads from their 10 rules to see if something is interesting to you)

## Abstracts

In this homework, the goal is for you to understand how to read and also write your own scientific abstract.

### Homework

1. Take a look at the "[Ten simple rules](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)" paper. You don't need to read the whole thing, but spend about 10 minutes trying to see some of the highlights.
2. Answer the following questions about a paper, based on the abstract quoted below:

> The question of how many marine species exist is important because it   
provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. Results: There are ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms, that 58,000-72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000-741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7-1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science. Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.

  (Answers of one or a few sentences should be sufficient)

- What would be your title for this article?
- What is the most important conclusion of this article?
- Why do you think this article is important (or unimportant)?
- Do you think this is a well-written abstract, why or why not?
