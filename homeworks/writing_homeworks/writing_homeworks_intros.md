## Virtual Class
### Introductions

**Due**: April 8th, 2019

This is the second homework assignment in our series, and will involve coming up with a bit of your own writing (and research).

As defined previously and introduction in a scientific paper provides "background on the topic, such as why it is important, what previous questions have been asked and what is still unknown" (See [Rule 6](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) in the paper we have been referencing.

**Bringing the reader in**
An introduction helps explain to your reader why your work is important - why did you have the questions you have, or why did you do the experiments you did? Often (even in a scientific journal) readers may not know as much about your subject as you do, so it's up to you to give them some context.

**Using references**
A reference or citation is a central to writing in science. Most of science is about building on previous discoveries. Sometimes, you are building on your own discoveries, but often you are building on the work of others. In class for example, we have been using PCR - a technique fundamental to molecular biology. You did not create it, yet it was a vital component of your work. Rather than give a complete explanation of PCR, you can cite the [paper](http://degradome.uniovi.es/jmpf/Bibliograf/Science%201987%20PCR%20Kary%20Mullis.pdf) that introduced PCR. This citation accomplishes several things:

1. Gives credit to the scientists who did the work
2. Establishes that the fact or methods you are discussing have been published (this is usually an indication that the work has been [peer reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) and is believable).
3. Brings the reader in - if you cite some fact that was unknown to the reader, they can look up the reference and learn more.
4. Saves space and time - your paper is not about PCR; if the reader wants to learn more, they can look up the reference.


**We will use the following protocol for references in our assignments**
See the full protocol [here](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2017_materials/blob/master/papers_articles/references_protocol.pdf).


1. In the paragraph of text, use an inline citation (author name(s), publication year). If there are more than 3 authors you can say (author1, author2, et.al., 2000)
    - For example:
        - "In our laboratory, we used PCR (Saiki, Gelfand, et.al, 1987) to amplify the DNA fragments."
2. In the references section, follow the protocol (End-of-document citations) to choose the reference format, base on where the information was taken from.

   - For example:
       - Randal K. Saki, David H. Gelfand, Susanne Stoffel, Stephen J. Scharf, Russel Giguchi, Glenn T. Horn, Karry B. Mullis, Henry A. Erlich. 1988. Primer-Directed Enzymatic Amplification of DNA with a Themostable DNA Polymerase. Science. 239():487-491.


## Assignment

**Part I**

Read the introduction section on the paper by Richard Roberts on RNA splicing [paper](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2017_materials/raw/master/papers_articles/mrna_splicing_annotated_ACroberts.pdf). and answer the following questions:
(It is *strongly* recommended you work with a partner(s) on these questions).

1. What was something that was unknown to other researcher before this paper was published (e.g. what is the mystery they are trying to solve)?
2. The authors mention that eukaryotic transcription might be like one of three other known systems (they refer to them as schemes). This is actually their hypothesis (e.g. eukaryotic transcription might be like one of the three). What are the three hypotheses?
3. What do they propose studying to make solve the problem (e.g. decide which hypothesis is correct)
4. What approach did they use to visualize the mRNA "R-loops"?


**Part II**

Write your own introduction to the GMO foods lab. The introduction should be 250 words or less. Unfortunately, since this is an experiment you did not create yourself, your question is very limited (e.g. is a food sample potentially genetically modified?). However, you can do the following in your short intro.

1. Explain what GMO is.
2. Explain why we are looking at 35s and Tubulin genes (v.s. looking at whatever
   DNA we can find in our sample).
3. Introduce the methods we used to obtain and DNA and detect the presence (i.e.
  electrophoresis band)
4. Use at least one reference to an article or published work.

Please feel free to use Wikipedia or any other published credible resource.
